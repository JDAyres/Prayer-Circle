# Unite in faith, pray in community

## Our Mission
To unite people of faith to have meaningful conversations and accountability for prayer. We aim to do this by creating a safe and private space for discussion.
## Features and Function
- Our app can be used by people of all ages. Invites are sent directly from person to person through QR codes, with no search or discovery feature. Users can also set their own moderators for their groups, which we call Circles.
- We aim to prevent the normal trap of social media: doomscrolling. Intentionality undergirds every aspect of our design, including a timer for time spent on the app and offline features should you want to take a break from the public stream.
- Users can make posts in three categories: praise, prayer request, and events, all of which have their own unique features.
